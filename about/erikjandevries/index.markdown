## Award-winning AI & MLOps Consultant

With over 13 years of experience, I have helped many organisations optimise the use of their data assets. To this end, I have developed a framework integrating **business**, **organisation** and **technology**, enabling me to demonstrate in a practical and pragmatic way how to:

1. embed data-driven decision-making into all types of business processes,
2. build effective analytics products, focussing on business value, and 
3. create an environment for success with data and analytics.

I have developed many AI solutions and built the MLOps platforms to bring them to production, for numerous organisations across different industries. Through trainings on various topics, including data science, MLOps and Generative AI, I empower my clients to fully own, operate and maintain these solutions independently after my engagement.

As a Data & Analytics strategy consultant, I aim for long-term success by defining ambitions for the future, laying out a roadmap to achieve those goals, and implementing tools to monitor progress along the way, enhancing the data and analytics capabilities and maturity of organisations.

In my spare time, I love playing the piano. A highlight in my musical career was playing [Gershwinâ€™s Rhapsody in Blue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJsnGprFRa8) at the concert hall in Haarlem. In 2021, I became father of a beautiful little girl.
